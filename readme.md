### Compiler labs (2018)
A x86-64 tiger compiler for SE302.

Because the testcases of lab5 are simple, lab5 has a few bugs and I fixed most of them when implementing Lab6.

lab6 might also contains bugs that are not detected by gradeMe.sh.

**The lab was implemented in 2018 and was written by C, rather than C++.**
